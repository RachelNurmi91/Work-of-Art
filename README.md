### Project Summary
Work of Art is a front-end interface for Springboard for the Arts Work of Art: Business Skills for Artists curriculum. The project was developed in collaboration with [Adia Morris Swanger](https://github.com/adiamorrisswanger/) for the final class project in the [Nucamp Software Developer Bootcamp](https://nucamp.co/). The initial application was a static website created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The goal of this redesign was to recreate the static site using a front-end JavaScripy library to make it more interactive and work in a collaborative environment using GitHub. We worked together to learn how to structure and build an application with React and Redux. It utilizes Javascript and React to interact with objects to create a functional and interactive website for students.
