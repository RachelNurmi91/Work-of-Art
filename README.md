# Work of Art

An interactive home for Springboard for the Arts Work of Art: Business Skills for Artists curriculum. Project was created in collaberation with [Adia Morris Swanger](https://github.com/adiamorrisswanger/) for the final class project in the [Nucamp Software Developer Bootcamp](https://nucamp.co/).

### Built with
* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned
The first draft of this project just consisted of functions passing functions until the game ended. I rebuilt this project to make it object oriented. Instead of functions passing through eachother a number of objects pass through one function. I learned how to pass functions by deconstructing objects and how to set a function as an object property.
